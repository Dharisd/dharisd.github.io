I wondered
can i log very passing vehicle? can i get their types (car,motorbike,truck)? can i get their speed? can i visualize how busy the and generate live reports based on the logged data? if so that would look darn cool
This could technically be acheived through
live stream of the road server to process the stream and run object detection and tracking backend to save the data Frontend to do cool visuals Final dashboard But how ?</description></item></channel></rss>
