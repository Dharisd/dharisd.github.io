The Detection object already has a list of features for the detections, So what needs to be done is for the Detection object to also have a list image crops of the detections taken using the Bounding box Data from the model.
This is done by adding a function to crop the detections and add to the Detections object
def _get_im_crops(self, bbox_xywh, ori_img): im_crops = [] for box in bbox_xywh: x1,y1,x2,y2 = self.</description></item><item><title>Real-time Vehicle Detection and Speed Estimation using YOLO and Deepsort</title><link>https://dharisd.github.io/posts/vehicle-monitor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 11:26:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://dharisd.github.io/posts/vehicle-monitor/</guid><description>Having a good view of the road infront and extra android phone laying around
I wondered
can i log very passing vehicle? can i get their types (car,motorbike,truck)? can i get their speed? can i visualize how busy the and generate live reports based on the logged data? if so that would look darn cool
This could technically be acheived through
live stream of the road server to process the stream and run object detection and tracking backend to save the data Frontend to do cool visuals Final dashboard But how ?</description></item></channel></rss>
